        <p> Greenhouse gases traps the infrared energy inside of them and radiates about half of it back to Earth as heat. 
            Moderate amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are good for the planet, 
            as it absorbs the heat from the sun and makes the planet warm. 
            Without it, our planet would be a frozen wasteland. However, during the last century, 
            the emission of greenhouse gases like CO<sub>2</sub> have increased by about 90% since 1970. 
            This results to too much heat being released back to Earth, 
            increasing the average global temperature in the past century. </p>
