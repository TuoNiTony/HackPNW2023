                    Greenhouse gases are gases that goes up in the atmosphere and is 
                    responsible for absorbing heat and releasing it in all directions.
                    Some goes in space and some back to Earth.
                    Main greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, water vapor,
                    nitrous oxide and methane which are natural compounds,
                    and fluorinated gases that are synthetically made.
