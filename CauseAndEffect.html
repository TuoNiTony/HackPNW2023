            &#x2022;More intense and/or frequent extreme weather events like droughts, heat waves and hurricanesWet <br> 
            &#x2022;regions are wetter, dry regions gets drier<br>
            &#x2022;Rising sea levels due to melting of icebergs and sea ice<br>
            &#x2022;Changes in ecosystems and natural habitats<br>
            &#x2022;Increased facilitation in movement of diseases<br>
            &#x2022;Warmer temperatures means more insects that carries diseases like malaria or zika virus can thrive easily

            <p>Heat and Electricity Production<br>
            &#x2022;Burning of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal to produce electricity contributes to a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions <br> 
            Agriculture<br>
            &#x2022;Methane is the greenhouse gas that is produced due to the decomposition of manure and passing of gas from dairy cows<br>
            Industry<br>
            &#x2022;This includes the manufacturing of goods and raw materials which is responsible for releasing mostly CO<sub>2</sub>, but also methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases<br>
            Transportation<br>
            &#x2022;Burning of gasoline and diesel to power the world's transportation system releases mainly carbon dioxide<br>
            Commercial & Residential<br>
            &#x2022;Burning of natural gas and oil used for heating and cooking releases mostly carbon dioxide and methane
